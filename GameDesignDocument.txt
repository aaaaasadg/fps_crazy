8. Enemy Scaling (Dynamic Difficulty)
Let time t = seconds since start
Difficulty level:
D = 1 + t / 60
(+1 difficulty every minute)
Enemy HP scaling
ScaledHP = BaseHP × (1.12)^(D - 1)
(+12% per minute)
Spawn rate scaling
SpawnRate(D) = BaseSpawnRate × (1 + 0.25 × (D - 1))
(+25% enemies per minute)
Base spawn rates:

Goblin Grunt: 0.8/s


Runner: 0.4/s


Brute: 0.2/s


Stone Golem: one every 90 seconds

XP & Gold scaling
Rewards scale slowly:
RewardMul(D) = 1 + 0.10 × (D - 1)

9. XP Curve (Level Ups)
XP required for next level:
XPToNext(L) = 50 + 25 × L
(Level 1→2 = 75 XP, Level 5→6 = 175 XP, Level 20→21 = 550 XP)
